<!--
**GRSE-FRS/GRSE-FRS** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


The project is built on Angular as the frontend technology and Flask as the the backend tech stack.

To get started.

##START THE BACKEND SERVER.
  1. cd to grse1
  2. type command "python main_app.py"
  3. This should start the backend server. The backend URL will be generated and will be http://localhost:5000/

##START THE FRONTEND SERVER.
  1. cd to grse_frontend-main
  2. type command "ng server"
  3. This should start the frontend server. The frontend URL will be generated and will be http://localhost:4200/
